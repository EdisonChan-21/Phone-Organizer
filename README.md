# Phone-Organizer
This assignment is about developing an application which can organize phone entries in a contact book which allow user to entry and store information of name, nickname, phone number, email address, last-call date and time. Moreover, users are allowed to store the entries under one of three groups specified by the user: Family, Friend or Junk. Also, the information of phone entries under a user-given group can be displayed or removed upon the userâ€™s request. The application requires user login so that the contact book would not be allowed to use unless username with corresponding password is provided.
